# Overview
This is a bit of code aimed at exploring supercontinuum generation. This is adapted from the lecture 'Introduction to NLSE simulation / supercontinuum generation' on youtube, by Miles Anderson, and translated into julia.

The code and parameters are those of Silicon Nitride. The `gnsle` algorithm has been taken from  J.C. Travers, M.H. Frosz and J.M. Dudley in Chapter 3 of the book "Supercontinuum Generation in Optical Fibers" Edited by J. M. Dudley and J. R. Taylor (Cambridge 2010), which has also been publised on github by J.C. Travers on https://github.com/jtravs/SCGBookCode
